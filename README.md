Currently in active development, but development happens on a private Azure DevOps repo due to GitHub's 100 MB file limit. Updates will be pushed to this repo periodically.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
1. Download [Godot 4.5](https://godotengine.org/releases/4.5/) and open the repository folder with Godot.
1. To run the project, click the Run Project button, found on the upper right corner of Godot's interface.

> [!NOTE]  
> When opening the project for the first time, you may notice hundreds of modified `*.res` files in your source control. This is a quirk of the Godot importer and these changes can be safely discarded once project has already been opened once.
