A level meant to test and showcase Godot features for big and open worlds.

Includes Godot-Human-For-Scale to run around the level.

Currently in active development, but development happens on a private Azure DevOps repo due to GitHub's 100 MB file limit. Updates will be pushed to this repo periodically.
