# Crater-Province-Level
## Motion Blur Testing
A branch of Crater-Province-Level meant to provide reproducible scenarios for testing motion blur.  
There is no motion blur enabled in the project by default: you must install and enable one yourself. I recommend sphynx's [JFA_driven_motion_blur_addon](https://github.com/sphynx-owner/JFA_driven_motion_blur_addon).

Scenarios are brief and fast on purpose, so that motion blur is triggered generously, and so that you can slow video recordings of it down in a video player/editor and pick apart at the details of the motion blur implementation.  
Only the car scenario has been implemented for now.

## Time Of Day
Use the LightingChanger node to change time of day in editor.
